# DC-Motor-Encoder
An Arduino library for controlling DC motor with rotary encoders

This library assumes you are driving your DC motor with a L-Bridge. For testing I am using [L298](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Robotics/ROB-09571-Serial%20Controlled%20Dual%20Motor%20Driver%20-%20v11.pdf)
and the [Parallax Motor with encoder #28819](https://www.parallax.com/sites/default/files/downloads/28819-6-15V-Gear-Motor-with-Encoder-Guide-v1.1.pdf)


NOTE: THIS IS VERY MUCH STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. JUST STARTED THIS AND IT IS STILL FORMING IF YOU HAVE IDEAS OF SUGGESTIONS PLEASE LET ME KNOW
